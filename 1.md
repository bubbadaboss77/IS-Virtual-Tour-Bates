#####This past week was dedicated largely towards getting familiar with the camera and also for mapping out the big picture of this virtual tour.  It has been a challenge for me to come up with a creative and seamless way to showcase all that our campus has to offer.  Our campus is physically too large to showcase all at once and the students’ perspectives are too diverse to portray just one group on campus.  This led me to the concept of different pathways that prospective students can align with while on their virtual tour.#####

#####A ‘pathway’ is just a way to break down Bates College’s diverse students and geography into more manageable sub-sections.  For example, there could be a pathway for each major which would give incoming students an unvarnished glimpse as to what academic life is really like at Bates.  More specifically, each pathway would consist of a conglomerate of matterport scans that represent a student's daily routine at Bates.  The specific details of this are still in the work as I continue to look into mapping technology and photogrammetry using google earth.  However, the basic idea of pathway will consist of a map of Bates that corresponds to the selected pathway.  Along this pathway, students will be able to follow the various pit stops that a Bates student that fits this criteria makes each day.  For example, as a physics major, I spend each day in my dorm, commons, and Carnegie science.  My vision is for this “pathway” to follow my day as I would.  Point A would be a matterport scan of my dorm.  Point B would be a matterport scan of commons.  And Point C would be a matterport scan of Carnegie etc. On a deeper level, these matterport scans will be enriched by multimedia content which can easily be embedded using Mattertag posts.  Videos of recorded lectures, presentations, and labs are all possibilities for a physics “pathway”.  But this is only really just the bare minimum.  In the coming weeks I will continue to do research regarding many of the different pathways that exist at Bates.  After all, Bates is a very diverse place with many different day-to-day athletic, academic, and social experiences.  Ultimately, the more of these we can capture the better.#####

#####I recently scanned the third floor of Carnegie Science (physics floor) and hope to compliment the scan with Mattertag posts.  This will give people a better sense of what I envision.  In this coming week, I hope to scan two more spaces along with its featured content.  In doing so, I hope to gain more fluency with the equipment and the software.  From my experience, however, the matterport camera has been a delight to use.#####

######I feel like I am in a good position now to start making this project a reality.  Through extensive research and thought, I have a good sense of what I need to do to start creating these paths, and I will continue to consult my peers in doing so.#####
